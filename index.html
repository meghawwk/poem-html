        <h3>there comes a humming bird humming</h3>
        <h3>flying over the narrow stream,flowing</h3>
        <h3>with the wind, the sun shining brightly</h3>
        <h3>the tree-leaves rustling and whispering</h3>
        <h3>clueless where to fly </h3>
        <h3>backward? forward? </h3>
        <h3>where to go? </h3>
        <h3>what is the point? </h3>
        <h3>all alone she is  </h3>
        <h3>couldn't even show her beautiful feathers </h3>
        <h3>covered in blue,nothing but blue </h3>
        <h3>is what the one who sees her says </h3>
        <h3>but you could still see the light  </h3>
        <h3>in her pitch dark eyes you could still see </h3>
        <h3>stars gleaming </h3>
        <h3>hoping, for something unattainable</h3>
        <h3>to reach the horizon</h3>
        <h3>but still doesn't know where to go</h3>
        <h3>what is the point? </h3>
        <h3>all alone she is  </h3>
        <h3>hoping, for someone to lend her a hand</h3>
        <h3>but who would?</h3>
        <h3>there's no one left anymore</h3>
        <h3>no more mutters, no more life</h3>
        <h3>clueless she is, the hummingbird</h3>
        <h3>but still humming</h3>
